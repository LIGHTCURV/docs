title: How Snyk finds out about new vulnerabilities
---

We monitor existing node.js security portals and tools, such as (Node Security Project)[https://nodesecurity.io/], the [nodejs-sec Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nodejs-sec), or [Retire.js](http://retirejs.github.io/retire.js/). We also monitor Github activity and other online sources for new vulnerabilities.
