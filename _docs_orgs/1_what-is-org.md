title: What’s a Snyk organisation?
---

An organisation groups projects, and can have team members who can access these projects.

When you sign up to Snyk, you’ll see you have a default organisation, named like your GitHub username. Any projects you add via the CLI or via GitHub integration will appear in this organisation by default.

You can create an organisation, or join one via invitation. If you have more than one organisation, you can switch between organisations via the web UI or in the CLI.

Notifications about newly disclosed vulnerabilities are per organisation; you can turn them on and off per organisation.

Snyk pricing works per organisation, so e.g. you can have your own default organisation on a free plan, while being a member of an organisation your company pays for.
