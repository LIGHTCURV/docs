title: Disabling the GitHub integration
---

If you don’t want to monitor a GitHub repo anymore, you can stop monitoring this project via the project settings. The project will be set to inactive, and you’ll no longer get alerts, pull requests, or Snyk test in your pull requests. The web hook that enables the GitHub integration for this repo will be removed. 

You can re-start monitoring at any time.
