In order to use Snyk with your GitHub Enterprise, Snyk will first need to enable broker support for one of your Snyk organisations.

To request broker support, contact [support@snyk.io] with the name of the organisation that you'd like to connect to your GitHub Enterprise.

Each broker is identified by a unique token. Once broker support has been enabled for your organisation, you can access your unique broker token on the organisation's settings page. This token is private, and must not be shared.
